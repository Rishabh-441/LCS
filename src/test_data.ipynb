(2) Group II: Department of ' Banking Operations, Development and InduStrial Finance Department and Department of Non banking Companies; (3) Group III: Agricultural Credit Department, (4) Group IV: Economic Department and Department of Statistics and (5) Group V: Industrial Development Bank of India.\", 'The depart ments falling within the first group were known as the general departments, while the departments falling within the other four groups were known as the specialised depart ments.', 'Though recruitment to these different groups of departments was 381 made on a common basis, each group of departments was treat ed as a separate unit for the purpose of determining the seniority and promotion of the employees within that group and this was done on centrewise basis.', 'The result was that there was a separate seniority list for the employees in each group of departments at each centre of the Reserve Bank and the employees could seek confirmation and promotion only in the vacancies arising within their own group of departments at their own centre.', 'There were two grades of clerks in each group of departments, namely, Grade I and Grade II.', 'The pay scales of Grade I and Grade II clerks in all the groups of depart ments were the same and their conditions of service were also identical.', 'There was automatic promotion from Grade II to Grade I and when a clerk from Grade II was promoted to officiate in Grade I he got an additional officiating allow ance of Rs. 25/ per month.', 'While Grade 1 and Grade II clerks in the specialised departments were invariably gradu ates, those in the general departments were not always so.', 'Some out of them were graduates, while others were non graduates.', 'There were also several categories of non clerical posts in the general as well as specialised depart ments.', 'They were in Grade II and the pay scale this Grade was the same as that of Grade II clerks in the general and specialised departments.', 'It appears from the Circular of the Reserve Bank dated 13th May, 1963 that Stenographers, Typists and Coin/ Note Examiners, though falling within the category of non clerical staff, were sometimes transferred as Grade II clerks and by this circular, it was decided that \"with effect from 1st July, 1963, the transfer of staff from one category to another should be governed\" by the principles there set out.', 'Two categories of transfers were contemplated by this Circular: one was transfer by selection and the other was transfer on grounds of health.', \"The first category of transfers by selection required that the Stenog rapher, Typist or Coin/Note Examiner seeking transfer would have to be a graduate or should have passed both parts of the Institute of Bankers ' Examination and his applica tion for transfer would be considered by the manager from the point of view of his record of service and his suitabil ity for transfer to the clerical grade and he would then have to appear for interview before a selection board and it was only if he was selected that he would be transferred as Grade II clerk.\", 'But once he was transferred as Grade II clerk, his seniority in the new cadre would be counted from the date on which he joined service, as a Typist or Coin/Note Examiner and in the case of a Stenographer, from the date on which he jointed service as a Typist or as a Stenographer in case he was directly recruited as such \"provided that the said date shall not_ be earlier than the date on which the transferee acquired the degree or banking qualification by reason of which he became eligible for such transfer: that is to say, in the case of a Coin/Note Examiner/ Typist/Stenographer who graduates or acquires the banking qualifications after the date of his joining serv ice, he will be deemed to have joined service \"only o, the date he acquired the said qualification\".', '382 The second category of transfers was on grounds of health.', 'However, that is not material for our purpose and we need not consider it.', \"It seems that in view 'of the expanding activities of the Reserve Bank in the Specialised Departments, there were greater opportunities for confirmation and promotion for employees in the specialised departments as compared to those available to employees in the general departments.\", 'This gave rise to dissatisfaction amongst employees in the general department and they claimed for equalising the confirmation and promotional opportunities by having a combined seniority list for all employees in Class III irrespective of the departments to which they belonged basing promotions on such combined seniority list.', 'This question was also raised by the Association before the National Tribunal consisting of Mr. Justice K.T. Desai and it was pleaded by the Association that \"all promotions should be made strictly according to the combined seniority irrespective of the cadre of department\".', 'The Reserve Bank, on the other hand, sought to justify the maintenance of separate seniority lists for various departments on the ground that the work in each department was becoming more and more of a special nature and inter transferability was not only undesirable in the best interest of the Bank, but it was also hard to achieve.', 'The National Tribunal, while not accepting the demand of the Association and expressing its inability to give any direction to the Reserve Bank in regard to this question, made the following observations in its Award: \" I can only, generally, observe that it is desirable that wherever it is possible, without detriment to the interests of the Bank and without affecting the efficiency, to group employees in a particular category serving in different depart ments at one Centre together for the purpose of being considered for promotion a common seniority list of such employees should be maintained.', 'The same would result in opening up equal avenues of promotion for a large number of employees and there would be lesser sense of frustration and greater peace of mind among the employees.', '\" These observations of the National Tribunal were ap proved by Hidayatullah, J., as he then was, speaking on behalf of this Court in All India Bank Employees Association vs Reserve Bank of India(1) at page 57.', 'In view of these observations of the National Tribu naI, which were endorsed by this Court, the Reserve Bank took the first step towards equalising the confirmation and promotional opportunities of employees in the General Departments by introducing the Optee Scheme of 1965 by a Circular dated 29th June, 1965.', 'Clause (1) of the Scheme provided that all vacancies in Grade II Clerks occurring in Specialised Departments in each centre upto 30th June, 1970 would be treated as expansion vacancies to be filled up by transfer of confirmed Grade II Clerks including officiat ing Grade I Clerks in the (1) ; 383 General Departments.', 'The manner in which these vacancies shall be filled was set out in clauses (2) and (3) which read inter alia as follows: \"A circular will be issued inviting applica tions in form \\'A \\' from confirmed graduate Clerks Grade 1I (including officiating Clerks Gr.', 'I) of the General Side (Group 1) for the preparation of a panel of suitable employees who are willing to opt for transfer to any of the Departments in Groups II, 1II and V at each centre under the optee scheme.', 'As regards the non clerical staff trans ferred to the clerical cadre, only those who have been absorbed against permanent vacancies of clerks Gr.', 'II on the General Side will be eligible to opt for transfer.', '(i) The panel will be a consolidated one, i.e., separate panels will not be prepared for each of the Departments in Groups II, 1II and V at each centre.', \"(ii) The option exercised by the employees will be subject to the approval of the 'Manager ' depending on their past record of service and suitability for transfer to departments in Groups II, III and V. (iii) (a) The position of employees on the panel, recruited directly as clerks Gr.\", 'II from the waiting list of graduate clerks Gr.', 'II will be determined according to their dates of recruitment.', '(b) In the case of employees recruited from the waiting list of undergraduate clerks Gr.', 'II who have become graduates while in service, and in the case of non clerical graduate staff transferred to the clerical cadre, their position in the panel will be determined according to their dates of graduation. (iv) As and when vacancies arise in the Depart ments in Groups II, III and V at each centre, they will be filled up by drawing on the panel, the first vacancy going to the first person on the panel, the second to the second and so on.', 'An employee will have no choice of the Department to which he will be posted.', 'The posting will be made in the order in which the vacancies arise.', '(v) Officiating clerks Gr.', 'I will be trans ferred only in their substantive capacity as clerks Gr.', 'II (vi) (a) The seniority of the optees on transfer to the Departments in Groups II, III and V will be determined on the basis that their trans fers to the concerned Departments have been made in the interest of the Bank, that is to say, the substantive position of the transferee in the seniority list of the Department concerned will be fixed above and employee who joined service after the date of his recruitment 384 or date of graduation as the case may be and below the employee who joined service before the date of his recruitment/graduation . (c) The above method of fixation will, howev er be subject to the provision that if a substan tively junior employee in the Department to which the transferee is posted is already officiating in that Department in a higher grade on a longterm basis on the date the transferee reports for duty that officiating employee will be considered senior to the transferee.', 'The inter se seniority of the transferee posted to the same Departments in Group II, III and V will be fixed in the order in which their names are listed in the panel . (viii) The panel will be revised annually.', '\" It will be seen that under the Scheme the option to go over to the Specialised Departments was confined to confirmed Grade II Clerks.', 'and offici ating Grade 1 Clerks in the General Departments.', 'But there also, every Grade II Clerk and Officiat ing Grade I Clerk was not entitled to be absorbed in the Specialised Departments as of right, but he had to go through a process of selection and the option exercised by him was \"subject to the approv al of the Manager depending on his past record of service and suitability for transfer\" to the Spe cialised Departments.', 'If he exercised the option and was selected, he would be entitled to be ab sorbed only as Grade II Clerk in one of the Specia lised Departments with the result that if he was an officiating Grade I Clerk in the General Depart ments at the time of the exercise of the option, he would lose the benefit of officiation in Grade I in the General Departments as also the monetary bene fit of Rs. 25/ per month which he was getting during such officiation.', 'His seniority in the cadre of Grade II Clerks in the SpeciaIised Department in which he was absorbed would be liable to be deter mined on the basis of his length of service calcu lated from the date of his recruitment if he was also a graduate when he joined service or from the date of his graduation if he became a graduate whilst in service.', 'The rationale behind this provision obviously was that graduation being_ regarded as essential qualification for being a Grade II Clerk in the Specialised Departments, the length of service from the date of graduation alone.', 'should be taken for the purpose of determin ing the seniority of transferees from the General Departments.', 'The petitioners in Writ Petition No. 690 of 1972, who may for the sake of convenience be hereafter referred to as the petitioners.', 'were, at the time of the introduction of the Optee Scheme of 1965, confirmed Grade II Clerks in the General Departments and some of them were officiating in the General Departments as Grade I Clerks.', \"Though most of the petitioners were recruited as Grade II Clerks from the beginning, so far as petitioners 4, 9, 16, 18, 19, 23 and 26 were concerned, they were originally recruited to non cleri cal posts and subsequently transferred as Grade II clerks by selection and that is how at the date when the Optee Scheme of 1965 came into force, they were confirmed Grade II Clerks in 'the General Departments.\", 'The 385 petitioners exercised the option under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and were absorbed substantively as confirmed Grade 1I Clerks in one or the other of the Specialised Departments.', 'Obviously, the consequence was that those of the petition ers who were officiating as Grade I Clerks in the General Departments lost their officiating position as a result of this transfer together with the attendant monetary benefit of Rs. 25/ per month.', 'Besides the petitioners, there were also other confirmed Grade I[ Clerks and Officiating Grade I Clerks in the General Departments who, having exercised the option and being selected, were taken over as confirmed Grade I1 Clerks in the Specialised Departments.', 'Some of them a few were, in due course, in order of seniority, promoted as Officiat ing Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Depart ments.', 'But before the turn of the petitioners for promo tion could arrive, a new Scheme was brought into force to which we shall presently refer.', 'It appears that the Asso ciation was not satisfied with the Optee Scheme of 1965 as it did not go far enough and equalised opportunities for only a section of the employees in the General Depart ments, namely confirmed Grade II Clerks and Officiating Grade I Clerks, leaving the rest in the same disadvantageous position as before.', 'The Association, therefore, continued to press its demand for complete equalisation of opportu nities and in 1969, the Reserve Bank took one further step with a view to partly satisfying that demand.', 'The Reserve Bank introduced another Scheme called the Optee Scheme of 1969 for transfer of confirmed Grade I Clerks in the Gener al Departments to the Specialised Departments to the extent of one third of the long term normal vacancies of Grade I Clerks arising in the Specialised Departments during the period from 1st February, 1969 to 30th June, 1970.', 'But this also did not satisfy the Association for what the Associa tion desired was full equalisation of opportunities between the General Departments and the Specialised Departments.', 'The Association continued to agitate for acceptance of its demand and ultimately, as a result of negotiations, an agreement dated 7th May, 1972 was arrived at between the.', 'Reserve Bank and the Association by which the demand of the Association was substantially conceded and the principle of a combined seniority list was accepted by the Reserve Bank.', 'The petitioners and some other employees were, however, not members of the Association and they refused to accept the terms of this agreement and hence the Reserve Bank issued a Circular dated 13th May, 1972 introducing d Scheme for combined seniority list and switched over from non clerical to clerical cadre with effect from 7th May, 1972.', 'This Scheme was substantially in the same terms as the agreement dated 7th May, 1972 and we shall hereafter, for the sake of convenience, refer to this Scheme as the Combined Seniority Scheme.', 'The Combined Seniority Scheme consisted broadly of two parts.', 'One part provided for the integration of the clerical staff of the General Departments with the clerical staff of the Specialised Departments and the other, for the switch over and integration of the non clerical staff with the clerical staff in all the Departments of the Reserve Bank 386 Clauses (8) and (9) dealt with the first part and they provided inter alia as follows: \"8.', 'Combined Seniority between clerical staff in dif ferent departments The seniority lists of the staff mentioned below work ing in the general side and Specialised Departments (i.e. in all the Groups 1 to V of the Department wise grouping) will be merged into one with effect from 7th May, 1972 in accordance with the provisions of clause 10 in the manner set out below: (a) All Clerks Grade II, Field Investigators and Clerks Grade I (with less than one year total officiating service) will be placed in the combined seniority list, relative seniority of an employee being fixed according to the date of his first appointment as Clerk/Field Investigator.', '(b) All confirmed Clerks Grade I, Clerks Grade I officiating as such on 7th May, 1972 with one year or more total officiating service, Assistants (temporary, officiating as well as confirmed) and Field Inspectors will be placed in the combined seniority list ranking as a group above the employ ees listed under sub clause (a) above.', 'The relative seniority of an employee will be fixed on the basis of the total length of service put in by him from the date he first started officiating as Clerk Grade I/Field Inspector after deducting therefrom periods during which he reverted as clerk Grade II/Field Investigator otherwise than on account of proceeding on leave.', '(c) Fixation of seniority as referred to in sub clauses (a) and (b) above will be subject to the proviso that the inter se position as between two employees in the existing groupwise/departmentwise seniority lists is not disturbed to the detriment of any senior employee within the same group/department except as provided for in clause 6 and sub clause (e) below.', \"(d) x x x x (e) ' The seniority of class III personnel having been fixed as provided for in sub clauses (a) and (b) above the seniority of an optee, selected clerk in the existing specialised departments whose seniority compared to his juniors in the existing General side is adversely affected will be protected to the extent of his entitlement had he not opted/been selected under the optee/select ed scheme: Provided that he shall apply in this regard in writing within one month from the date of notification of the combined seniority list.\", 'Applications 387 for such adjustments will not be entertained after expiry of the period stipulated above.', '(i) (a) Employees officiating as Clerks Grade I on 7lb May, 1972.', 'An employee officiating as a Clerk Grade I as on 7th May 1972 will continue to officiate without prejudice to the claims of employees whose position may be above him in the.', 'combined seniority list.', 'he reverts, his next promotion will be according to his substantive seniority in the combined list.', 'Reversion only on account of proceeding on leave will not be deemed as reversion for the purpose this clause.', '(b) Promotion as Clerks Grade I between 7th May 1972 and the notification of the combined seniority list.', 'Promotions during this period will be made with reference to the existing departmental/groupwise seniority list but without prejudice to the claims of seniors in the combined seniority list.', 'When the combined seniority list, becomes available, a review of all such promotions made in the interre gum will be made and senior employees not officiat ing in the higher grades will be promoted by re placing the junior employees.', 'The review will be completed within a period of two weeks.', '(c) Promotions as Clerks Grade I thereafter.', 'Promotions will be made from the combined seniority list\" The second part Was provided for in clauses (1) to (7) and these clauses, so far as material read thus: \"1.', 'Combined seniority between clerical staff and eligible non clerical stall opting for switchover: (a) All employees in Class III non clerical cadre substantively in the categories that have been listed as groups I, Iii, IV and V in the annexure (Reference is not to the department wise groups) who are graduates or have passed both parts of Institute of Bankers Examination will be eligible to exercise an option in accordance with sub clause (a) or (b) of clause 2 to be transferred, automat ically and without any screening, to posts in the clerical cadre which are vacant and are other than of a purely stop gap or short term nature, subject to subclause (b) below.', 'Actual transfer to posi tions involving clerical duties will be effected in a phased manner as laid down in clause 7.', '(b) On such option being exercised within the period of two months as per clause 2 (a), or one month as per clause 2 (b) as the case may be, the position of such optee will be fixed in the com bined seniority list by counting for the purpose of seniority in the clerical cadre onethird of his total non clerical service in Class III in the 388 Bank until 7th May 1972 or the date of acquiring the qualification i.e. the date of publication of the results of the examination, as the case may be (vide clauses 3(a) and 3(b).', '(a) x x x x (b) Any employee who acquires the qualifica tion for eligibility after the 7th May 1972, will have, within one month of acquiring the said qualification, to exercise his option whether he desires to switch over to the clerical cadre with his seniority being determined as per clause I(b).', 'The option once exercised shall be final subject to the right of revocation and with the same consequences, as at subclause (a) above.', \"Those eligible but not exercising the option within the, aforesaid period of one month shall lose 'the right of option thereafter.\", '(a) The notional seniority in the clerical cadre of those employees who are eligible for switchover on the 7th May 1972 and exercise their option under clause 2(a) will be fixed with effect from 7th May 1972.', '(b) In respect of employees who acquire the eligibility qualification in future and exercise their option under clause 2(b), their notional seniority in the clerical cadre will be fixed with effect from the date of acquiring such quali fication viz. date of publication of the results of the examination.', '(c) Fixation of seniority whether under sub clause (a) or (b) will, however, be subject to the proviso that the inter se position as between two employ ees in the concerned seniority list of non cleri cal employees as it stood immediately before the 7th May 1972 or the date of acquiring the qualification for switchover is not disturbed to the detriment of a senior employee as in the relevant seniority list.', '(Illustration for fixation of seniority is Enclo sure.', \"I) 4.(a) An employee opting for switchover will, for the, purpose of compilation of the combined sen iority list, be deemed to be a member of 'the clerical cadre with effect from the date as at clauses 3(a)and 3(b), as the case may be.\", '(b) Until such time as he is actually transferred to the clerical

officiating in a category that is listed as group II, VI, VII or VIII of Annexure as the ease may be confirmed in that category only if he revokes his earlier option before confirmation, for which he will have an opportunity.', '\" 389 _It may be pointed out that though the Optee Scheme of 1965 was originally intended to be operative only upto 30th June, 1970, it was .continued right upto the time that the Combined seniority Scheme came into force.', \"The effect of the Combined Seniority Scheme was .that it superseded the Optee Scheme of 19 '65.\", 'The petitioners were ,aggrieved by the Combined Seniority Scheme since according to them it affected their chances of confirmation and promotion and placed them in a disadvantageous position and accordingly they filed Civil Writ No. 690 of 1972 in the Delhi High Court challenging the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme on various grounds relatable to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.', 'These grounds of challenge found favour with the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court which heard the petition and the Division Bench quashed and set aside the Combined Seniority Scheme on the view that it was viola tive of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.', 'The three main grounds on which the Division Bench found fault with the Combined Seniority Scheme were first, that it discrimi nated against the petitioners vis a vis.', 'the others who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and who had obtained promotion as Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Departments before the introduction of the Combined Seniori ty Scheme;secondly, it discriminated against the petitioners in relation to the .', 'clerical staff in the General Depart ments who either did not exercise the option under the Optee Scheme of 1965 or having exercised the option, were not selected and thirdly, it treated alike the non clerical staff as well as the clerical staff by integrating them together in one cadre with a combined seniority list, though they formed two distinct and separate classes unequal to each other.', 'The Division Bench accordingly allowed the petition and struck down the Combined Seniority Scheme.', 'Two appeals were thereupon preferred to this Court after obtaining a certificate of fitness from the Delhi High Court, Civil Appeal No. 1231 of 1973 by the Reserve Bank and Civil Appeal No. 1408 of 1974 by the Association.', 'Both the Reserve Bank and the Association seek to sustain the validi ty of the Combined Seniority Scheme in these appeals sub stantially on the same grounds.', 'We will assume for the purpose of these appeals that the Reserve Bank is a \"State\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and hence subject to the limitations imposed by Article 14 and 16.', 'It was in fact so held by the Delhi High Court and this view was not seriously assailed before us on behalf of the Reserve Bank.', 'The question which, therefore, requires to be considered is whether the Combined Seniority Scheme in any way falls foul of Articles 14 and 16.', 'The Delhi High Court relied on three grounds for invalidating the Combined Seniority Scheme under Articles 14 and 16 and the same three grounds were also canvassed before us in these appeals, but we do not think there is any sub stance in them.', 'We shall examine these grounds in the order in which they were advanced before us.', 'The first ground was that the Combined Seniority Scheme discriminated unjustly against the petitioners vis a vis those confirmed Grade II Clerks and Officiating Grade I Clerks in the General Departments who either did not exer cise the option under the Optee Scheme 390 of 1965, or, having exercised the option, were not selected.', 'The argument of the petitioners under tiffs head of chal lenge was that the Optee Scheme of 1965 was introduced by the Reserve Bank for the purpose of improving the promotion al opportunities of Grade II Clerks in the General Depart ments by absorbing them in the cadre of Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments where there were greater promotional opportunities by reason of a larger number of posts in the higher grades.', 'That was the implied assurance given by the Reserve Bank as part of the Optee Scheme of 1965 and the petitioners, acting on this assurance, exer cised the option to be transferred as confirmed Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments, some of them even giving up their officiating position as Grade I Clerks and losing in the process the officiating monetary allowance of Rs. 25/ per month.', 'The Reserve Bank was, in the circum stances, precluded from introducing the Combined Seniority Scheme which had the effect of prejudicing the promotional opportunities assured to the petitioners, until the peti tioners got their promotion to higher posts in the Specia lised Departments in accordance with such assurance.', 'The position, however, which obtained when the Combined Senior ity Scheme was brought into force was that the petitioners were still confirmed Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments, while, as compared to them, some of the Grade II Clerks in the General Departments, who were junior to the petitioners and who had either not exercised the option or, having exercised the option, were not selected were already promoted as Grade 1 Clerks in the General Departments.', 'In this situation, the effect of the Combined Seniority Scheme was that though theoretically, by reason of cl.', '(8)(c), the petitioners were given seniority over these Grade II Clerks who had been promoted as Grade I Clerks in the General Departments, the latter retained their higher Grade I in the Combined Seniority Scheme and thus secured an advantage over the petitioners.', 'This was the anomalous and unjust result brought about by the Combined Seniority Scheme and that, according to the petitioners, introduced a serious infirmi ty.', 'This argument, we are afraid, is more an argument of hardship than of law and we do not think we can accept it.', 'When the petitioners opted to be transferred to the Specialised Departments under the Optee Scheme of 1965, they obviously did so as they thought that they would have quicker chances of promotion in the Specialised Department than in the General Departments.', 'But it appears that before their turn for promotion as Grade I Clerks in the Specialised Departments could come, some vacancies occurred in the cadre of Grade I Clerks in the General Departments and naturally they were filled up by promotion of Grade II Clerks in the General Departments.', 'Some of these Grade II Clerks who were promoted were junior to the petitioners, but they got an opportunity for promotion as the petitioners went out of the General Departments by exercising the option to be transferred to the Specialised Departments.', 'This was a wholly fortuitous possibly not anticipated by the petition ers or perhaps the petitioners might have thought that they would have an advantage in the matter subsequent promotions to posts higher 391 than Grade I Clerks.', 'Be that as it may, the fact remains that this was the position which obtained at the date when the Combined Seniority Scheme was introduced by the Reserve Bank.', 'The question is, was there anything which prevented the Reserve Bank from doing so ? We fail to see how from the mere introduction of the Optee Scheme of 1965, any promise or assurance could be spelt out on the part of the Reserve Bank not to take any steps towards integration of other employees not covered by the Optee Scheme of 1965.', 'The Reserve Bank could not, on any principle of law or by any process of implication, be held bound to hold its hands in the matter of further inte gration, until the petitioners were promoted in the Specia lised Departments.', 'And the question would again.be: promoted how far one stage or two stages or more than that ? It is obvious that the only object of the Optee Scheme of 1965 was to equalise the promotional opportunities of Grade II Clerks in the General Departments with those of Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments by giving an option to the former to be absorbed in the latter.', 'This object was car ried out as soon as the petitioners and other Grade II Clerks in the General Departments opted to be transferred to the Specialised Departments.', 'Then they became Grade H Clerks in the Specialised Departments having the same promotional opportunities as the original Grade II Clerks in the Specia lised Departments.', 'There was no assurance given by the Reserve Bank that the promotional opportunities available to Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments will not be diminished.', 'The Combined Seniority Scheme affected the promotional opportunities of all Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments, irrespective of whether they were original or transferee Grade II Clerks.', 'It did not discrim inate between transferee Grade II Clerks and original Grade II Clerks and treated them alike in bringing about total integration of the employees in the several Departments.', 'There was no breach of the principle that the promotional opportunities of transferee Grade II Clerks should be equal to those of original grade II Clerks.', 'Both were ef fected equally by the Combined Seniority Scheme.', 'Now under the Combined Seniority Scheme, the integration could only be on grade to grade basis and, therefore, if by the time the Combined Seniority Scheme came into force, Grade II Clerks, junior to tile petitioners, had become Grade I Clerks in the General Departments, they could be equated only with Grade I Clerks in the Specialised Departments and to this equation, no valid objection could be taken on behalf of the petition ers.', 'Undoubtedly, it would cause heart burning amongst the petitioners to find that Grade II Clerks, junior to them in the General Departments, have become Grade I Clerks in the integrated service, while they still continue to be Grade II Clerks, but that is a necessary consequence of integration.', 'Whenever services are integrated, some hardship is bound to result.', 'Reasonable anticipations may be belied.', 'The second ground on which the petitioners challenged the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme was that it discriminated against the petitioners vis a vis other Grade II Clerks who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and obtained promotion as Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Departments before the introduction of the 9 1104SCI/76 392 Combined Seniority Scheme.', 'The contention of the petition ers was that some of the Grade I1 Clerks who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 were promoted as Grade I Clerks, while the petitioners continued as Grade II Clerks and before their turn for promotion could arrive, the Combined Seniority Scheme was brought into force and that prejudi cially affected their promotional opportunities and thus brought about unjust discrimination between persons belong ing to the same class.', 'This contention has no force and must be rejected.', 'We have already discussed and shown that it was competent to the Reserve Bank to introduce the Com bined Seniority Scheme for the purpose of integrating the clerical staff in all the departments and the Reserve Bank was not bound to wait until all the transferee Grade II Clerks under the Optee Scheme of 1965 were promoted as Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Departments.', 'There was not such assurance given by the Reserve Bank when it introduced the Optee Scheme of 1965.', 'What it did was merely to equalise the opportunities Grade II Clerks in the General Departments with those of Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments.', 'The Reserve Bank did not undertake that it will not take any steps for bringing about total integration of the clerical services until all the transferee Grade II Clerks were promoted.', 'The Reserve Bank was entitled to introduce the Combined Seniority Scheme at any time it though fit and the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme cannot be assailed on the ground that it was intro duced at a time when some of the transferee Grade II Clerks still remained to be promoted and was discriminatory against them.', 'It may be that some transferee Grade I1 Clerks had already obtained promotion as Grade I Clerks by the time the Combined Seniority Scheme was introduced, while others like the petitioners had not.', 'But that cannot be helped.', 'It is all part of the incidence of service and in law, no griev ance can be made against it.', 'That takes us to the last ground of challenge which relates to integration of non clerical with clerical serv ices.', 'This ground of challenge was advanced under three heads: first, non clerical services and clerical services were wholly different from each other and by integrating them into one cadre, the Reserve Bank failed to recognise their differences and treated unequals as equals, thereby offending the equality clause of the Constitution secondly, by permitting, in case of non clerical staff, one third of the total non clerical service until 7th May, 1972 and in case of those who become graduates or pass both parts of institute of Bankers Examination subsequent to 7th May, 1972 until the date of acquiring such qualification to be taken into account for the purpose of seniority, the Reserve Bank laid down a wholly irrational and unjust principle of sen iority in the integrated service and thereby violated the equal opportunity clause and lastly, the seniority of the petitioners was adversely affected by the integration with out giving any opportunity to them to represent against it and the Combined Seniority Scheme was, therefore, in viola tion of the principles of natural justice.', 'We have careful ly examined these three heads of challenge, but we do not find any substance in them.', 'They are based on a misconcep tion of the true nature of the process involved in integra tion of non clerical with clerical services.', 'There was, as already 393 pointed out above, a non clerical cadre in each Department of the Reserve Bank and it was decided by the Reserve Bank that the nonclerical cadres in all the Departments should be integrated with the clerical cadre.', 'With that end in view, the Combined Seniority Scheme gave an option to all employ ees in non clerical cadres to be transferred to posts in the clerical cadre, but in the interest of efficiency, pre scribed a qualification that only those employees in non clerical cadres would be entitled to be transferred who are either graduates or have passed both parts of Institute of Bankers Examination.', 'Now, when the employees from non clerical cadres are admitted in the clerical cadre, some rule would have to be made for determining their seniori ty vis a vis those in the clerical cadre.', 'They would have to be fitted into the clerical cadre and for that purpose, some rule would have to be devised for determining how they shall rank in seniority.', 'The Combined Seniority Scheme adopted the rule that for determining the seniority of non clerical staff who exercised the option and were admit ted in the clerical cadre, one third of their total non clerical service \"until 7th May, 1972 or the date of acquir ing qualification\" should be taken into account.', 'This was the manner in which the Combined Seniority Scheme sought to bring about integration of non clerical with.', 'clerical serv ices in the several departments of the Bank.', 'Now, the first question which arises for consideration is whether the Reserve Bank violated the constitutional princi ple of equality in bringing about integration of non cleri cal with clerical services.', 'We fail to see how integration of different cadres into one cadre can be said to involve any violation of the equality clause.', 'It is now well set tled, as a result of the decision of this Court in Kishori Mohanlal Bakshi vs Union of India(1) that Article 16 a fortiori also Article 14 do not forbid the creation of different cadres for government service.', 'And if that be so, equally these two Articles cannot stand in the way of the State integrating different cadres into one cadre.', 'It is entirely a matter for the State to decide whether to have several different cadres or one integrated cadre in its services.', 'That is a matter of policy which does not attract the applicability of the equality clause.', 'The integration of non clerical with clerical services sought to be effectuated by the Combined Seniority Scheme cannot in the circumstances be assailed as violative of the constitutional principle of equality.', 'Then we come to the question of the rule of seniority adopted by the Combined Seniority Scheme.', 'Now there can be no doubt that it is open to the State to lay down any rule which it thinks appropriate for determining seniority in service and it is not competent to the Court to strike down such rule on the ground that in its opinion another rule would have been better or more appropriate.', 'The only en quiry which the Court can make is whether the rule laid down by the State is arbitrary and irrational so that it results in inequality of opportunity amongst employees belonging to the same class.', 'Now, here, employees from non clerical cadres were being absorbed in the clerical cadre and, there fore, a rule for determining their seniority vis a vis (1) A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 1139.', '394 those already in the clerical cadre had to be devised.', \"Obviously, if the non clerical service rendered by the ' employees from non clerical cadres were wholly ignored, it would have been most unjust to them.\", 'Equally, it would have been unjust to employees in the clerical cadre, if the entire non clerical service of those coming from non cleri cal cadres were taken into account, for non clerical service cannot be equated with clerical service and the two cannot be treated on the same footing.', 'Reserve Bank, therefore, decided that one third of the non clerical service ren dered by employees coming from non clerical cadres should be taken into account for the purpose of determining seniority.', 'This rule attempted to strike a just balance between the conflicting claims of non clerical and clerical staff and it cannot be condemned as arbitrary or discriminatory.', 'Vide: Anand Parkash Saksena vs Union of India.(1) The last contention of the petitioners was that seniori ty is a civil right and the State cannot interfere with it to the prejudice of an employee without giving an opportuni ty to him to be heard and since the Combined Seniority Scheme adversely affected the seniority of the petitioners in the clerical cadre without giving them an opportunity to represent against it, it was void and inoperative.', 'There are two answers to this contention and each is, in our opinion, fatal.', 'In the first place, we do not find from the judgment of the High Court that this contention was at any time advanced before the High Court and, in the circum stance.s, we do not think it would be fight to permit it to be raised for the first time before this Court.', 'Secondly, even if this contention were allowed to be raised, we do not think it can be sustained.', 'Here, there was no question of any existing seniority being disturbed by change in the rule of seniority.', 'The problem was of fitting into the clerical cadre employees coming from non clerical cadres and for that purpose, a new rule was required to be made which would determine the seniority of these new entrants vis a vis those already in the clerical cadre.', 'Such rule did not affect seniority and hence there could be no question of giving the petitioners an opportunity to make representation against it.', 'These were the only contentions urged before us against the constitutional validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme and since there is no substance in them, we think that the High Court was in error in striking down the Combined Sen iority Scheme.', 'We accordingly allow the appeals, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and uphold the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme.', 'There will be no order as to costs.', 'V,P.S. Appeals allowed.', '(1) [1968] 2 S.C.R. 611, 622.']\n",

Shroff for Respondent 36.The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.The Reserve Bank of India is the appel lant in ' Civil Appeal No. 1231 of 1973.This appeal, on certificate, is directed against a judgment of the High Court of Delhi allowing Writ Petition No. 690 of 1972 filed by some of the employees of the Reserve Bank challenging the validity of the combined seniority Scheme issued by the Reserve Bank of India by its Circular dated 13th May, 1972.This judgment of the High Court is also assailed by the All India Reserve Bank Employees Association (hereinafter referred to as the Association) by preferring Civil Appeal No. 1408 of 1974 after obtaining certificate from the High Court.Both these appeals have been heard together since they are directed against the same judgment and all the arguments raised on behalf of the appellants are also common except one additional argument advanced on behalf of ,the Association in Civil Appeal No. 1408 of 1974.The facts giving rise to these two appeals are a little important and it is necessary to state ,them in order to appreciate the questions arising for determination in the appeals.The primary purpose for which the ,Reserve Bank of India was originally constituted was \"to regulate the issue of bank notes and the keeping of the reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to oper ate the currency and the credit system of the country to its advantage\".But in course of time other functions came to be added as a result of various statutes passed by the Parliament from time to time to meet the economic needs of the country.The administrative machinery of the Reserve Bank ' for carrying out these diverse functions was at the material time divided into the following five groups of departments: (1) Group I: General Side.that is, Banking Department, Issue Department, Public Debt Division and Exchange Control Department; (2) Group II: Department of ' Banking Operations, Development and InduStrial Finance Department and Department of Non banking Companies; (3) Group III: Agricultural Credit Department, (4) Group IV: Economic Department and Department of Statistics and (5) Group V: Industrial Development Bank of India.The depart ments falling within the first group were known as the general departments, while the departments falling within the other four groups were known as the specialised depart ments.Though recruitment to these different groups of departments was 381 made on a common basis, each group of departments was treat ed as a separate unit for the purpose of determining the seniority and promotion of the employees within that group and this was done on centrewise basis.The result was that there was a separate seniority list for the employees in each group of departments at each centre of the Reserve Bank and the employees could seek confirmation and promotion only in the vacancies arising within their own group of departments at their own centre.There were two grades of clerks in each group of departments, namely, Grade I and Grade II.The pay scales of Grade I and Grade II clerks in all the groups of depart ments were the same and their conditions of service were also identical.There was automatic promotion from Grade II to Grade I and when a clerk from Grade II was promoted to officiate in Grade I he got an additional officiating allow ance of Rs. 25/ per month.While Grade 1 and Grade II clerks in the specialised departments were invariably gradu ates, those in the general departments were not always so.Some out of them were graduates, while others were non graduates.There were also several categories of non clerical posts in the general as well as specialised depart ments.They were in Grade II and the pay scale this Grade was the same as that of Grade II clerks in the general and specialised departments.It appears from the Circular of the Reserve Bank dated 13th May, 1963 that Stenographers, Typists and Coin/ Note Examiners, though falling within the category of non clerical staff, were sometimes transferred as Grade II clerks and by this circular, it was decided that \"with effect from 1st July, 1963, the transfer of staff from one category to another should be governed\" by the principles there set out.Two categories of transfers were contemplated by this Circular: one was transfer by selection and the other was transfer on grounds of health.The first category of transfers by selection required that the Stenog rapher, Typist or Coin/Note Examiner seeking transfer would have to be a graduate or should have passed both parts of the Institute of Bankers ' Examination and his applica tion for transfer would be considered by the manager from the point of view of his record of service and his suitabil ity for transfer to the clerical grade and he would then have to appear for interview before a selection board and it was only if he was selected that he would be transferred as Grade II clerk.But once he was transferred as Grade II clerk, his seniority in the new cadre would be counted from the date on which he joined service, as a Typist or Coin/Note Examiner and in the case of a Stenographer, from the date on which he jointed service as a Typist or as a Stenographer in case he was directly recruited as such \"provided that the said date shall not_ be earlier than the date on which the transferee acquired the degree or banking qualification by reason of which he became eligible for such transfer: that is to say, in the case of a Coin/Note Examiner/ Typist/Stenographer who graduates or acquires the banking qualifications after the date of his joining serv ice, he will be deemed to have joined service \"only o, the date he acquired the said qualification\".382 The second category of transfers was on grounds of health.However, that is not material for our purpose and we need not consider it.It seems that in view 'of the expanding activities of the Reserve Bank in the Specialised Departments, there were greater opportunities for confirmation and promotion for employees in the specialised departments as compared to those available to employees in the general departments.This gave rise to dissatisfaction amongst employees in the general department and they claimed for equalising the confirmation and promotional opportunities by having a combined seniority list for all employees in Class III irrespective of the departments to which they belonged basing promotions on such combined seniority list.This question was also raised by the Association before the National Tribunal consisting of Mr. Justice K.T. Desai and it was pleaded by the Association that \"all promotions should be made strictly according to the combined seniority irrespective of the cadre of department\".The Reserve Bank, on the other hand, sought to justify the maintenance of separate seniority lists for various departments on the ground that the work in each department was becoming more and more of a special nature and inter transferability was not only undesirable in the best interest of the Bank, but it was also hard to achieve.The National Tribunal, while not accepting the demand of the Association and expressing its inability to give any direction to the Reserve Bank in regard to this question, made the following observations in its Award: \" I can only, generally, observe that it is desirable that wherever it is possible, without detriment to the interests of the Bank and without affecting the efficiency, to group employees in a particular category serving in different depart ments at one Centre together for the purpose of being considered for promotion a common seniority list of such employees should be maintained.The same would result in opening up equal avenues of promotion for a large number of employees and there would be lesser sense of frustration and greater peace of mind among the employees.\" These observations of the National Tribunal were ap proved by Hidayatullah, J., as he then was, speaking on behalf of this Court in All India Bank Employees Association vs Reserve Bank of India(1) at page 57.In view of these observations of the National Tribu naI, which were endorsed by this Court, the Reserve Bank took the first step towards equalising the confirmation and promotional opportunities of employees in the General Departments by introducing the Optee Scheme of 1965 by a Circular dated 29th June, 1965.Clause (1) of the Scheme provided that all vacancies in Grade II Clerks occurring in Specialised Departments in each centre upto 30th June, 1970 would be treated as expansion vacancies to be filled up by transfer of confirmed Grade II Clerks including officiat ing Grade I Clerks in the (1) ; 383 General Departments.The manner in which these vacancies shall be filled was set out in clauses (2) and (3) which read inter alia as follows: \"A circular will be issued inviting applica tions in form 'A ' from confirmed graduate Clerks Grade 1I (including officiating Clerks Gr.I) of the General Side (Group 1) for the preparation of a panel of suitable employees who are willing to opt for transfer to any of the Departments in Groups II, 1II and V at each centre under the optee scheme.As regards the non clerical staff trans ferred to the clerical cadre, only those who have been absorbed against permanent vacancies of clerks Gr.II on the General Side will be eligible to opt for transfer.(i) The panel will be a consolidated one, i.e., separate panels will not be prepared for each of the Departments in Groups II, 1II and V at each centre.(ii) The option exercised by the employees will be subject to the approval of the 'Manager ' depending on their past record of service and suitability for transfer to departments in Groups II, III and V. (iii) (a) The position of employees on the panel, recruited directly as clerks Gr.II from the waiting list of graduate clerks Gr.II will be determined according to their dates of recruitment.(b) In the case of employees recruited from the waiting list of undergraduate clerks Gr.II who have become graduates while in service, and in the case of non clerical graduate staff transferred to the clerical cadre, their position in the panel will be determined according to their dates of graduation. (iv) As and when vacancies arise in the Depart ments in Groups II, III and V at each centre, they will be filled up by drawing on the panel, the first vacancy going to the first person on the panel, the second to the second and so on.An employee will have no choice of the Department to which he will be posted.The posting will be made in the order in which the vacancies arise.(v) Officiating clerks Gr.I will be trans ferred only in their substantive capacity as clerks Gr.II (vi) (a) The seniority of the optees on transfer to the Departments in Groups II, III and V will be determined on the basis that their trans fers to the concerned Departments have been made in the interest of the Bank, that is to say, the substantive position of the transferee in the seniority list of the Department concerned will be fixed above and employee who joined service after the date of his recruitment 384 or date of graduation as the case may be and below the employee who joined service before the date of his recruitment/graduation . (c) The above method of fixation will, howev er be subject to the provision that if a substan tively junior employee in the Department to which the transferee is posted is already officiating in that Department in a higher grade on a longterm basis on the date the transferee reports for duty that officiating employee will be considered senior to the transferee.The inter se seniority of the transferee posted to the same Departments in Group II, III and V will be fixed in the order in which their names are listed in the panel . (viii) The panel will be revised annually.\" It will be seen that under the Scheme the option to go over to the Specialised Departments was confined to confirmed Grade II Clerks.and offici ating Grade 1 Clerks in the General Departments.But there also, every Grade II Clerk and Officiat ing Grade I Clerk was not entitled to be absorbed in the Specialised Departments as of right, but he had to go through a process of selection and the option exercised by him was \"subject to the approv al of the Manager depending on his past record of service and suitability for transfer\" to the Spe cialised Departments.If he exercised the option and was selected, he would be entitled to be ab sorbed only as Grade II Clerk in one of the Specia lised Departments with the result that if he was an officiating Grade I Clerk in the General Depart ments at the time of the exercise of the option, he would lose the benefit of officiation in Grade I in the General Departments as also the monetary bene fit of Rs. 25/ per month which he was getting during such officiation.His seniority in the cadre of Grade II Clerks in the SpeciaIised Department in which he was absorbed would be liable to be deter mined on the basis of his length of service calcu lated from the date of his recruitment if he was also a graduate when he joined service or from the date of his graduation if he became a graduate whilst in service.The rationale behind this provision obviously was that graduation being_ regarded as essential qualification for being a Grade II Clerk in the Specialised Departments, the length of service from the date of graduation alone.should be taken for the purpose of determin ing the seniority of transferees from the General Departments.The petitioners in Writ Petition No. 690 of 1972, who may for the sake of convenience be hereafter referred to as the petitioners.were, at the time of the introduction of the Optee Scheme of 1965, confirmed Grade II Clerks in the General Departments and some of them were officiating in the General Departments as Grade I Clerks.Though most of the petitioners were recruited as Grade II Clerks from the beginning, so far as petitioners 4, 9, 16, 18, 19, 23 and 26 were concerned, they were originally recruited to non cleri cal posts and subsequently transferred as Grade II clerks by selection and that is how at the date when the Optee Scheme of 1965 came into force, they were confirmed Grade II Clerks in 'the General Departments.The 385 petitioners exercised the option under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and were absorbed substantively as confirmed Grade 1I Clerks in one or the other of the Specialised Departments.Obviously, the consequence was that those of the petition ers who were officiating as Grade I Clerks in the General Departments lost their officiating position as a result of this transfer together with the attendant monetary benefit of Rs. 25/ per month.Besides the petitioners, there were also other confirmed Grade I[ Clerks and Officiating Grade I Clerks in the General Departments who, having exercised the option and being selected, were taken over as confirmed Grade I1 Clerks in the Specialised Departments.Some of them a few were, in due course, in order of seniority, promoted as Officiat ing Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Depart ments.But before the turn of the petitioners for promo tion could arrive, a new Scheme was brought into force to which we shall presently refer.It appears that the Asso ciation was not satisfied with the Optee Scheme of 1965 as it did not go far enough and equalised opportunities for only a section of the employees in the General Depart ments, namely confirmed Grade II Clerks and Officiating Grade I Clerks, leaving the rest in the same disadvantageous position as before.The Association, therefore, continued to press its demand for complete equalisation of opportu nities and in 1969, the Reserve Bank took one further step with a view to partly satisfying that demand.The Reserve Bank introduced another Scheme called the Optee Scheme of 1969 for transfer of confirmed Grade I Clerks in the Gener al Departments to the Specialised Departments to the extent of one third of the long term normal vacancies of Grade I Clerks arising in the Specialised Departments during the period from 1st February, 1969 to 30th June, 1970.But this also did not satisfy the Association for what the Associa tion desired was full equalisation of opportunities between the General Departments and the Specialised Departments.The Association continued to agitate for acceptance of its demand and ultimately, as a result of negotiations, an agreement dated 7th May, 1972 was arrived at between the.Reserve Bank and the Association by which the demand of the Association was substantially conceded and the principle of a combined seniority list was accepted by the Reserve Bank.The petitioners and some other employees were, however, not members of the Association and they refused to accept the terms of this agreement and hence the Reserve Bank issued a Circular dated 13th May, 1972 introducing d Scheme for combined seniority list and switched over from non clerical to clerical cadre with effect from 7th May, 1972.This Scheme was substantially in the same terms as the agreement dated 7th May, 1972 and we shall hereafter, for the sake of convenience, refer to this Scheme as the Combined Seniority Scheme.The Combined Seniority Scheme consisted broadly of two parts.One part provided for the integration of the clerical staff of the General Departments with the clerical staff of the Specialised Departments and the other, for the switch over and integration of the non clerical staff with the clerical staff in all the Departments of the Reserve Bank 386 Clauses (8) and (9) dealt with the first part and they provided inter alia as follows: \"8.Combined Seniority between clerical staff in dif ferent departments The seniority lists of the staff mentioned below work ing in the general side and Specialised Departments (i.e. in all the Groups 1 to V of the Department wise grouping) will be merged into one with effect from 7th

VIII of Annexure as the ease may be confirmed in that category only if he revokes his earlier option before confirmation, for which he will have an opportunity.\" 389 _It may be pointed out that though the Optee Scheme of 1965 was originally intended to be operative only upto 30th June, 1970, it was .continued right upto the time that the Combined seniority Scheme came into force.The effect of the Combined Seniority Scheme was .that it superseded the Optee Scheme of 19 '65.The petitioners were ,aggrieved by the Combined Seniority Scheme since according to them it affected their chances of confirmation and promotion and placed them in a disadvantageous position and accordingly they filed Civil Writ No. 690 of 1972 in the Delhi High Court challenging the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme on various grounds relatable to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.These grounds of challenge found favour with the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court which heard the petition and the Division Bench quashed and set aside the Combined Seniority Scheme on the view that it was viola tive of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.The three main grounds on which the Division Bench found fault with the Combined Seniority Scheme were first, that it discrimi nated against the petitioners vis a vis.the others who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and who had obtained promotion as Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Departments before the introduction of the Combined Seniori ty Scheme;secondly, it discriminated against the petitioners in relation to the .clerical staff in the General Depart ments who either did not exercise the option under the Optee Scheme of 1965 or having exercised the option, were not selected and thirdly, it treated alike the non clerical staff as well as the clerical staff by integrating them together in one cadre with a combined seniority list, though they formed two distinct and separate classes unequal to each other.The Division Bench accordingly allowed the petition and struck down the Combined Seniority Scheme.Two appeals were thereupon preferred to this Court after obtaining a certificate of fitness from the Delhi High Court, Civil Appeal No. 1231 of 1973 by the Reserve Bank and Civil Appeal No. 1408 of 1974 by the Association.Both the Reserve Bank and the Association seek to sustain the validi ty of the Combined Seniority Scheme in these appeals sub stantially on the same grounds.We will assume for the purpose of these appeals that the Reserve Bank is a \"State\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and hence subject to the limitations imposed by Article 14 and 16.It was in fact so held by the Delhi High Court and this view was not seriously assailed before us on behalf of the Reserve Bank.The question which, therefore, requires to be considered is whether the Combined Seniority Scheme in any way falls foul of Articles 14 and 16.The Delhi High Court relied on three grounds for invalidating the Combined Seniority Scheme under Articles 14 and 16 and the same three grounds were also canvassed before us in these appeals, but we do not think there is any sub stance in them.We shall examine these grounds in the order in which they were advanced before us.The first ground was that the Combined Seniority Scheme discriminated unjustly against the petitioners vis a vis those confirmed Grade II Clerks and Officiating Grade I Clerks in the General Departments who either did not exer cise the option under the Optee Scheme 390 of 1965, or, having exercised the option, were not selected.The argument of the petitioners under tiffs head of chal lenge was that the Optee Scheme of 1965 was introduced by the Reserve Bank for the purpose of improving the promotion al opportunities of Grade II Clerks in the General Depart ments by absorbing them in the cadre of Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments where there were greater promotional opportunities by reason of a larger number of posts in the higher grades.That was the implied assurance given by the Reserve Bank as part of the Optee Scheme of 1965 and the petitioners, acting on this assurance, exer cised the option to be transferred as confirmed Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments, some of them even giving up their officiating position as Grade I Clerks and losing in the process the officiating monetary allowance of Rs. 25/ per month.The Reserve Bank was, in the circum stances, precluded from introducing the Combined Seniority Scheme which had the effect of prejudicing the promotional opportunities assured to the petitioners, until the peti tioners got their promotion to higher posts in the Specia lised Departments in accordance with such assurance.The position, however, which obtained when the Combined Senior ity Scheme was brought into force was that the petitioners were still confirmed Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments, while, as compared to them, some of the Grade II Clerks in the General Departments, who were junior to the petitioners and who had either not exercised the option or, having exercised the option, were not selected were already promoted as Grade 1 Clerks in the General Departments.In this situation, the effect of the Combined Seniority Scheme was that though theoretically, by reason of cl.(8)(c), the petitioners were given seniority over these Grade II Clerks who had been promoted as Grade I Clerks in the General Departments, the latter retained their higher Grade I in the Combined Seniority Scheme and thus secured an advantage over the petitioners.This was the anomalous and unjust result brought about by the Combined Seniority Scheme and that, according to the petitioners, introduced a serious infirmi ty.This argument, we are afraid, is more an argument of hardship than of law and we do not think we can accept it.When the petitioners opted to be transferred to the Specialised Departments under the Optee Scheme of 1965, they obviously did so as they thought that they would have quicker chances of promotion in the Specialised Department than in the General Departments.But it appears that before their turn for promotion as Grade I Clerks in the Specialised Departments could come, some vacancies occurred in the cadre of Grade I Clerks in the General Departments and naturally they were filled up by promotion of Grade II Clerks in the General Departments.Some of these Grade II Clerks who were promoted were junior to the petitioners, but they got an opportunity for promotion as the petitioners went out of the General Departments by exercising the option to be transferred to the Specialised Departments.This was a wholly fortuitous possibly not anticipated by the petition ers or perhaps the petitioners might have thought that they would have an advantage in the matter subsequent promotions to posts higher 391 than Grade I Clerks.Be that as it may, the fact remains that this was the position which obtained at the date when the Combined Seniority Scheme was introduced by the Reserve Bank.The question is, was there anything which prevented the Reserve Bank from doing so ? We fail to see how from the mere introduction of the Optee Scheme of 1965, any promise or assurance could be spelt out on the part of the Reserve Bank not to take any steps towards integration of other employees not covered by the Optee Scheme of 1965.The Reserve Bank could not, on any principle of law or by any process of implication, be held bound to hold its hands in the matter of further inte gration, until the petitioners were promoted in the Specia lised Departments.And the question would again.be: promoted how far one stage or two stages or more than that ? It is obvious that the only object of the Optee Scheme of 1965 was to equalise the promotional opportunities of Grade II Clerks in the General Departments with those of Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments by giving an option to the former to be absorbed in the latter.This object was car ried out as soon as the petitioners and other Grade II Clerks in the General Departments opted to be transferred to the Specialised Departments.Then they became Grade H Clerks in the Specialised Departments having the same promotional opportunities as the original Grade II Clerks in the Specia lised Departments.There was no assurance given by the Reserve Bank that the promotional opportunities available to Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments will not be diminished.The Combined Seniority Scheme affected the promotional opportunities of all Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments, irrespective of whether they were original or transferee Grade II Clerks.It did not discrim inate between transferee Grade II Clerks and original Grade II Clerks and treated them alike in bringing about total integration of the employees in the several Departments.There was no breach of the principle that the promotional opportunities of transferee Grade II Clerks should be equal to those of original grade II Clerks.Both were ef fected equally by the Combined Seniority Scheme.Now under the Combined Seniority Scheme, the integration could only be on grade to grade basis and, therefore, if by the time the Combined Seniority Scheme came into force, Grade II Clerks, junior to tile petitioners, had become Grade I Clerks in the General Departments, they could be equated only with Grade I Clerks in the Specialised Departments and to this equation, no valid objection could be taken on behalf of the petition ers.Undoubtedly, it would cause heart burning amongst the petitioners to find that Grade II Clerks, junior to them in the General Departments, have become Grade I Clerks in the integrated service, while they still continue to be Grade II Clerks, but that is a necessary consequence of integration.Whenever services are integrated, some hardship is bound to result.Reasonable anticipations may be belied.The second ground on which the petitioners challenged the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme was that it discriminated against the petitioners vis a vis other Grade II Clerks who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and obtained promotion as Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Departments before the introduction of the 9 1104SCI/76 392 Combined Seniority Scheme.The contention of the petition ers was that some of the Grade I1 Clerks who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 were promoted as Grade I Clerks, while the petitioners continued as Grade II Clerks and before their turn for promotion could arrive, the Combined Seniority Scheme was brought into force and that prejudi cially affected their promotional opportunities and thus brought about unjust discrimination between persons belong ing to the same class.This contention has no force and must be rejected.We have already discussed and shown that it was competent to the Reserve Bank to introduce the Com bined Seniority Scheme for the purpose of integrating the clerical staff in all the departments and the Reserve Bank was not bound to wait until all the transferee Grade II Clerks under the Optee Scheme of 1965 were promoted as Grade I Clerks in their respective Specialised Departments.There was not such assurance given by the Reserve Bank when it introduced the Optee Scheme of 1965.What it did was merely to equalise the opportunities Grade II Clerks in the General Departments with those of Grade II Clerks in the Specialised Departments.The Reserve Bank did not undertake that it will not take any steps for bringing about total integration of the clerical services until all the transferee Grade II Clerks were promoted.The Reserve Bank was entitled to introduce the Combined Seniority Scheme at any time it though fit and the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme cannot be assailed on the ground that it was intro duced at a time when some of the transferee Grade II Clerks still remained to be promoted and was discriminatory against them.It may be that some transferee Grade I1 Clerks had already obtained promotion as Grade I Clerks by the time the Combined Seniority Scheme was introduced, while others like the petitioners had not.But that cannot be helped.It is all part of the incidence of service and in law, no griev ance can be made against it.That takes us to the last ground of challenge which relates to integration of non clerical with clerical serv ices.This ground of challenge was advanced under three heads: first, non clerical services and clerical services were wholly different from each other and by integrating them into one cadre, the Reserve Bank failed to recognise their differences and treated unequals as equals, thereby offending the equality clause of the Constitution secondly, by permitting, in case of non clerical staff, one third of the total non clerical service until 7th May, 1972 and in case of those who become graduates or pass both parts of institute of Bankers Examination subsequent to 7th May, 1972 until the date of acquiring such qualification to be taken into account for the purpose of seniority, the Reserve Bank laid down a wholly irrational and unjust principle of sen iority in the integrated service and thereby violated the equal opportunity clause and lastly, the seniority of the petitioners was adversely affected by the integration with out giving any opportunity to them to represent against it and the Combined Seniority Scheme was, therefore, in viola tion of the principles of natural justice.We have careful ly examined these three heads of challenge, but we do not find any substance in them.They are based on a misconcep tion of the true nature of the process involved in integra tion of non clerical with clerical services.There was, as already 393 pointed out above, a non clerical cadre in each Department of the Reserve Bank and it was decided by the Reserve Bank that the nonclerical cadres in all the Departments should be integrated with the clerical cadre.With that end in view, the Combined Seniority Scheme gave an option to all employ ees in non clerical cadres to be transferred to posts in the clerical cadre, but in the interest of efficiency, pre scribed a qualification that only those employees in non clerical cadres would be entitled to be transferred who are either graduates or have passed both parts of Institute of Bankers Examination.Now, when the employees from non clerical cadres are admitted in the clerical cadre, some rule would have to be made for determining their seniori ty vis a vis those in the clerical cadre.They would have to be fitted into the clerical cadre and for that purpose, some rule would have to be devised for determining how they shall rank in seniority.The Combined Seniority Scheme adopted the rule that for determining the seniority of non clerical staff who exercised the option and were admit ted in the clerical cadre, one third of their total non clerical service \"until 7th May, 1972 or the date of acquir ing qualification\" should be taken into account.This was the manner in which the Combined Seniority Scheme sought to bring about integration of non clerical with.clerical serv ices in the several departments of the Bank.Now, the first question which arises for consideration is whether the Reserve Bank violated the constitutional princi ple of equality in bringing about integration of non cleri cal with clerical services.We fail to see how integration of different cadres into one cadre can be said to involve any violation of the equality clause.It is now well set tled, as a result of the decision of this Court in Kishori Mohanlal Bakshi vs Union of India(1) that Article 16 a fortiori also Article 14 do not forbid the creation of different cadres for government service.And if that be so, equally these two Articles cannot stand in the way of the State integrating different cadres into one cadre.It is entirely a matter for the State to decide whether to have several different cadres or one integrated cadre in its services.That is a matter of policy which does not attract the applicability of the equality clause.The integration of non clerical with clerical services sought to be effectuated by the Combined Seniority Scheme cannot in the circumstances be assailed as violative of the constitutional principle of equality.Then we come to the question of the rule of seniority adopted by the Combined Seniority Scheme.Now there can be no doubt that it is open to the State to lay down any rule which it thinks appropriate for determining seniority in service and it is not competent to the Court to strike down such rule on the ground that in its opinion another rule would have been better or more appropriate.The only en quiry which the Court can make is whether the rule laid down by the State is arbitrary and irrational so that it results in inequality of opportunity amongst employees belonging to the same class.Now, here, employees from non clerical cadres were being absorbed in the clerical cadre and, there fore, a rule for determining their seniority vis a vis (1) A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 1139.394 those already in the clerical cadre had to be devised.Obviously, if the non clerical service rendered by the ' employees from non clerical cadres were wholly ignored, it would have been most unjust to them.Equally, it would have been unjust to employees in the clerical cadre, if the entire non clerical service of those coming from non cleri cal cadres were taken into account, for non clerical service cannot be equated with clerical service and the two cannot be treated on the same footing.Reserve Bank, therefore, decided that one third of the non clerical service ren dered by employees coming from non clerical cadres should be taken into account for the purpose of determining seniority.This rule attempted to strike a just balance between the conflicting claims of non clerical and clerical staff and it cannot be condemned as arbitrary or discriminatory.Vide: Anand Parkash Saksena vs Union of India.(1) The last contention of the petitioners was that seniori ty is a civil right and the State cannot interfere with it to the prejudice of an employee without giving an opportuni ty to him to be heard and since the Combined Seniority Scheme adversely affected the seniority of the petitioners in the clerical cadre without giving them an opportunity to represent against it, it was void and inoperative.There are two answers to this contention and each is, in our opinion, fatal.In the first place, we do not find from the judgment of the High Court that this contention was at any time advanced before the High Court and, in the circum stance.s, we do not think it would be fight to permit it to be raised for the first time before this Court.Secondly, even if this contention were allowed to be raised, we do not think it can be sustained.Here, there was no question of any existing seniority being disturbed by change in the rule of seniority.The problem was of fitting into the clerical cadre employees coming from non clerical cadres and for that purpose, a new rule was required to be made which would determine the seniority of these new entrants vis a vis those already in the clerical cadre.Such rule did not affect seniority and hence there could be no question of giving the petitioners an opportunity to make representation against it.These were the only contentions urged before us against the constitutional validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme and since there is no substance in them, we think that the High Court was in error in striking down the Combined Sen iority Scheme.We accordingly allow the appeals, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and uphold the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme.There will be no order as to costs.V,P.S. Appeals allowed.(1) [1968] 2 S.C.R. 611, 622.\n",
      "[\"At every centre of the Reserve Bank of India there were five departments, the General Department and four Specialised Departments.There was a separate seniority list for the employees in each Department at each centre and confirmation and promotion of employees was only in the vacancies arising within their Department at each centre.There were two grades of clerks in each Department, namely, Grade I and Grade 11.The pay scales of Grade I and Grade II clerks in all the departments were the same and their conditions of service were also identical.There was automatic promotion from Grade II to Grade I and when a clerk from Grade H was promoted to officiate in Grade I, he got an additional officiating allowance of Rs. 25/ per month.There were also several categories of non,clerical posts in the General as well as Specialised Departments, and their pay scale was the same as that of Grade II clerks.In view of expanding activities in the Specialised Departments, there were great er opportunities for confirmation and promotion for employ ees in the Specialised Departments than in the General Department.This gave rise to dissatisfaction amongst employees in the General Department and they claimed equal opportunities by having a combined seniority list for all the clerks for confirmation and promotion.The Reserve Bank, sought to justify the separate seniority lists on the ground that the work in each department was of a special nature and inter transferability was undesirable and hard to achieve.As a result of the recommendation Of the National Tribunal, however, the Reserve Bank introduced the Optee Scheme of 1965 as h first step towards equalization of opportunities.Under the Scheme, the option to go over to the Specialised Departments was confined to confirmed Grade 11 clerks and officiating Grade I clerks in the General Department.If he exercised the option, he was eligible to be selected.If he was selected, he would be entitled to be absorbed only as Grade II clerk in one of the Specialised Departments with the result that if he was an officiating Grade I clerk in the General Department at the time of the exercise of the option, he would lose the benefit of officiation in Grade I in the General Department as also the monetary benefit of Rs. 25/ .His seniority in the cadre of Grade II clerks in the Specialised Department in Which he was absorbed would be determined on the basis of his length of service calculated from the date of his recruitment if he was a graduate when he joined service, or from the date of his graduation if he became a graduate whilst in service.The petitioners in the present case and some others were, at the time of introduction of the Optee Scheme, confirmed Grade II clerks in the General Department and some of them were officiating in the General Department as Grade I clerks.They exercised the option under the Optee Scheme land were absorbed substantively as confirmed Grade II clerks in one or the other of the Specialised Departments.The clerks, other than the petitioners were in due course, in order of seniority, promoted as officiating Grade I clerks in their respective Specialised Departments.But before the turn of the petitioners for promotion came, a new ' Scheme was introduced on May 13, 1972 as a result of continuous agitation by the employees for full equalisation of opportunities between the General Department and the Specialised Departments.This Scheme was known as the Combined Seniority Scheme, and it superseded the Optee Scheme.It consisted of two parts.One part provided for the integration of the clerical staff of the General Depart ment with the clerical staff of the Specialised Departments, and the other, 378 for the integration of the non clerical staff with the clerical staff in all the Departments.The Combined Seniori ty Scheme gave an option to the non clerical employees to be transferred to posts in the clerical cadre, but in the interest of efficiency, prescribed a qualification that only those employees in non clerical cadres would be transferred who arc either graduates or have passed both parts of Insti tute of Bankers Examination.For determining their seniori ty vis a vis those in the clerical cadre, the Combined Seniority Scheme adopted the rule that one third of their total non clerical service until 7th May, 1972 (the date on which agreement was reached between the Bank and its employ ees in the terms of the Combined Seniority Scheme) or the date of acquiring the qualification should be taken into account.The petitioners successfully challenged the Combined Seniority Scheme in the High Court.The High Court held that the Scheme was violative of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, because: (1) The position which obtained when the Combined Seniority Scheme was brought into force was that the petitioners were still confirmed Grade 11 clerks in the Specialised Departments, while some of the Grade II clerks in the General Departments, who were junior to them and who had either not exercised the option, or having exercised the option, were not selected, were promoted as Grade 1 Clerks in the General Departments.The result was that these Grade 11 clerks who had been promoted as Grade I Clerks in the General Department were equated to Grade I Clerks in the Specialised Departments.Therefore, according to the petitioners, the Combined Seniority Scheme had the effect of prejudicing the promotional opportunities assured to the petitioners under the Optee Scheme and hence the Combined Seniority Scheme discriminated against the petitioners in relation to the clerical staff in the General Department who either did not exercise the option under the Optee Scheme or having exercised the option, were not selected; (2) it discriminated against the petitioners vis a vis others who had opted under the Optee Scheme of 1965 and who had obtained promotion as Grade I clerks in their respective Specialised Departments before the intro duction of the Combined Seniority Scheme; and (3) (a) the Scheme treated alike the non clerical staff as well as the clerical staff by integrating them together in one cadre with a combined seniority list though they formed two dis tinct and separate classes, and thus violated the equali ty clause; (b) by permitting, in the case of non clerical staff, one third of the total non clerical service until 7th May, 1972 or the date of acquiring the qualification, to be taken into account for the purpose of seniority, the Bank laid down a wholly irrational and unjust principle of sen iority in the integrated service and violated the equal opportunity clause and; (c) the seniority of the petitioners was adversely affected by the integration without giving any opportunity to them and thus the introduction of the Com bined Seniority Scheme violated the principles of natural justice.Allowing the appeal to this Court and upholding the validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme.HELD: (1) Assuming that the Reserve Bank is State under article 12, and therefore subject to articles 14 and 16, by the mere introduction of the Optee Scheme no promise or assur ance could be spelt out on the part of the Bank not to take any steps towards integration of other employees not covered by the Optee Scheme.The Reserve Bank could not, on any principle of law or by any process of implication, be held bound to hold its hands in the matter of further inte gration, until the petitioners were promoted in the Specia lised Departments.The only object of the Optee Scheme was to equalise the promotional opportunities of Grade II clerks in the General Departments with those of Grade II clerks in the Specialised Departments by giving an option to the former to be absorbed in the latter.This object was carried out as soon as the petitioners and other Grade II clerks in the General Departments opted to be transferred to the Specialised Departments.Then they became Grade I1 clerks in the Specialised Departments having the same promo tional opportunities as the original Grade 1I clerks in the Specialised Departments.There was no assurance given by the Bank that the promotional opportunities available to Grade II clerks in the Specialised Departments will not be dimin ished.The Combined Seniority Scheme affected the promo tional opportunities of all Grade II clerks in the Specia lised Departments, irrespective of whether they were origi nal or transferee Grade II clerks.It did not discriminate between transferee Grade II clerks and original 379 Grade II clerks.There was no breach of the principle that the promotional opportunities of transferee Grade 11 clerks should be equal to those of original Grade II clerks.The fact that some of the Grade II clerks, junior to the peti tioners, had become Grade I clerks in the General Depart ments, and so could be equated only with Grade I clerks in the Specialised Departments is a wholly fortuitous result.It might cause heart burning amongst the petitioners that they still continue to be Grade II clerks but whenever services are integrated, some hardship is bound to result as a necessary consequence of integration.B G] (2) The Reserve Bank did not undertake that it will not take any steps for bringing about total integration of the clerical services until all the transferee Grade II clerks were promoted.The Reserve Bank was entitled to introduce the Combined Seniority Scheme at any time it thought fit and its validity cannot be assailed on the ground that it was introduced at a time when some of the transferee Grade II clerks still remained to be promoted and so was discrimina tory against them.The fact that some transferee Grade II clerks had already obtained promotion as Grade I clerks in the Specialised Departments by the time the Combined Senior ity Scheme was introduced, is all part of the exigencies of service and in law no grievance can be made against it.[392 D E] (3) (a) The integration of different cadres into one cadre cannot be said to involve any violation of the equali ty clause.It is entirely a matter for the State to decide whether to have several different cadres or one integrated cadre in its services.That is a matter of policy which does not attract the applicability of the equality clause.The integration of non clerical with clerical service sought to be effectuated by the Combined Seniority Scheme cannot, in the circumstances, be assailed as violative of the prin ciple of quality.[393 F] Kishori Mohanlal Bakshi vs Union of India AIR 1962 S.C. 1139 referred to (b) It is open to the State to lay down any rule which it thinks appropriate for determining seniority in service and it is not competent to the Court to strike down such a rule on the ground that in its opinion another rule would have been better or more appropriate.The only enquiry which the Court can make is whether the rule laid down by the State is arbitrary and irrational so that it results in inequality of opportunity amongst employees belonging to the same class.[393 G H] In the present case the employees from non clerical cadres were being absorbed in the clerical cadre, and, therefore, a rule for determining their seniority vis a vis those already in the clerical cadre had to be devised.To ignore their .entire non clerical service would have been unjust to them, and to take into account their entire non clerical services would be unjust to those in the clerical service.The Bank therefore, decided that one third of the non clerical service rendered by the employees coming from non clerical cadres should be taken into account for the purpose of determining seniority.It strikes a just balance between the conflicting claims of non clerical and clerical staff and cannot be condemned as arbitrary or discriminato ry.[394 A B] Anand Parkash Saksena vs Union of India [1968] 2 S.C.R. 611, referred to.(c) (i) The contention that there was violation of princi ples of natural justice was not raised before the High Court; (ii) Even if the contention is allowed be raised in this Court, there was no question of any existing seniority of the petitioners being disturbed by changing the rule of seniority.The problem was fitting into the clerical cadre employees coming from non clerical cadres.For that purpose, a new rule was required to be made.The rule did not affect the petitioners ' seniority, and hence, there was no question of giving the petitioners an opportunity to make representa tion against it.[394 E]\", 'The karta of a joint Hindu family fell ill.He had no male issue arid in order to safeguard the interests of the appellant and fourth respondent, who were his

different railway establishments.The relief claimed in all the petitions is that the workers concerned should be treated as railway employees and should be extended all service conditions which are available to the railway employees.For convenience sake, the canteens have been classified into three categories, viz., (i) Statutory canteens; (ii) Non statutory Recognised Canteens, and (iii) Non Statutory Non Recognised canteens.Chapter XXVIII of the Railway Establishment Manual contains the necessary instructions for running the can teens.Paragraph 2829 of Chapter XXVIII of the Manual refers to the provisions of Section 46 of the and under writes the fact that under these provisions, there is a statutory obligation on the Railway Administration to set up canteens in Railway establishments which are governed by the said Act and which employ more than 250 persons.Paragraph 2831 lays down the principles governing the set ting up of the canteens which apply also to the non statuto ry canteens provided for under paragraph 2830.Paragraph 2832 inter alia states that although the Administration can employ as agent a Staff Committee or a Co operative Society for management, the legal responsibility for proper manage ment rests not with the agency but solely with the Railway Administration.The Department of Personnel & Training, Ministry of Personnel, Government of India, had issued Administrative Instructions on Departmental Canteens in Offices and Indus trial Establishments of the Government.It is made clear in these instructions that the orders issued under the said Instructions are applicable to all Canteens/Tiffin Rooms functioning or to be set up in any Ministry, Department, Establish 688 ment, Office, or Installation of the government of India (Industrial or non industrial), including those functioning under the Ministries of Defence, P & T and Railways unless these three Ministries had previously decided to exempt any of the said Instructions due to specific reasons.It was contended on behalf of the petitioner workers that, in view of the documents on record there is no reason why the employees in the canteens concerned should not be given the status of the railway employees with all conse quential benefits.On the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the Railways that (i) the canteen employees are appointed by the Staff Managing Committees or Co operative Societies and not by the Railway Administration and as such there is no rela tionship of master and servant between the Railwasy Adminis tration and the Canteen employees, and in no case can they be deemed as holders of civil posts, either for Article 309 or for Article 311 of the Constitution; (ii) the control exercised by the Railway administration is only to ensure that the canteens are run in conformity with certain re quirements; (iii) the Railways have a primary objective of carrying goods and passengers and the welfare activities are ancillary to the main objective; (iv) the canteens continue at the discretion of the Railway Administration, and at any stage the Government can change the form of this welfare measure and choose to have another set up; (v) the Railways undertake varied welfare activities, and if it is decided to treat the employees engaged in the canteens as railway employees, it will be difficult to resist the claim from employees of these other institutions for a similar status; and (vi) the Railway Establishment Manual contains the necessary instructions for running the canteens, and hence the Railway Administration should be deemed to have been exempted from the operation of the Administrative Instruc tions on Departmental Canteens in Offices and Industrial Establishments of the Government, issued by the Department of Personnel & Training.Allowing the petitions filed by the employees of the statutory canteens and non statutory (recognised) canteens.and dismissing those of the non statutory (non recognised) canteens.this Court.HELD: Statutory Canteens (1) In terms of the Rules made by the State Governments under Section 46 of the it is obligatory on the Railway Administration to provide a canteen in an establishment which employs 689 more than 250 persons.The provision of the canteen is therefore, deemed by the statute as a necessary concomitant of the manufacturing activity.[692C; G] The employees of the departmental canteens/tiffin rooms were declared as holders of civil posts under the Government of India Notification dated December 11, 1979 which is annexed to the Administrative Instructions on Departmental Canteens in Offices and Industrial Establish ments of the Government.That Notification states that all posts in the said canteens/tiffin rooms are to be treated as posts in connection with the affairs of the Union, and hence the incumbents would qualify as holders of civil posts.Accordingly, service rules were framed under Article 309 as per the notification issued by the Government of India, Department of Personnel & Training on December 23, 1980.[705H; 706A B] (3) The provisions contained in the Administrative Instructions, show that the Government has a complete con trol over the canteens and the workers employed therein 'are holders of civil posts within the meaning of Article 311 of the Constitution.There recruitment and service conditions are governed by the rules applicable to the employees of the Department/Office/Establishment to which the canteens are attached.[701E] (4) Although there is nothing expressly on record to show that the railway canteens are exempted from the said Administrative Instructions, but even assuming that the railway canteens are exempted by virtue of the relevant provisions of the Railway Manual, the fact remains that there are as yet no notifications on the lines of December 11, 1979 and December 23, 1980 issued for the benefit of the employees in the railway canteens.[706E F] (5) It cannot be argued that there is any difference in the work performed by the employees in the canteens run in the establishments of the Ministries.If the said two noti fications are applicable to the employees in the canteens run by the other departments of the Government of India, there is no reason why the same should not apply also to the employees in the canteens run by the Railways.In the cir cumstances, it would be highly discriminatory not to apply the said two notifications to the employees in the Railway canteens.It would be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.The employees in the Statutory canteens of the Railways will therefore have to be treated as Railway serv ants.[706F H; 707A] 690 (6) Thus the relationship of employer and employee stands created between the Railway Administration and the canteen employees from the very inception.Hence, it cannot be gainsaid that for the purposes of the the employees in the statutory canteens are the employees of the Railways.[707B] Order dated 22.10.1980 in Civil Appeal No. 368 of 1978 (Supreme Court); Madras High Court; Writ Appeals Nos.414 415 of 1978.referred to.(7) If by virtue of all these facts the employees are entitled to the status of Railway employees they cannot be deprived of that status merely because some other employees similarly or dis similarly situated may also claim the same status.The argument to say the least can only be described as one in terroram.and as any other argument of the kind has to be disregarded.[708E] Non Statutory Recognised Canteen (8) These canteens are run in the establishments which employ 250 or less than 2.50 employees; and are established with the prior approval and recognition of the Railway Board.There is hardly any difference between the statutory canteens and non statutory recognised canteens.The only material difference is that while one is obligatory under the , the other is not.However.there is no difference in the management of the two type of canteens.[71 I G; 712C] (9) The Administration Instructions on Departmental Canteens in Government Offices and Government Industrial Establishments do not make any difference between the two so far as their applicability is concerned.Hence, it cannot be seen why any distinction be made between the employees of the two types of canteens so far as their service conditions are concerned.For this very reason, the two notifications of December 11, 1979 and December, 23, 1980 should also be equally applicable to the employees of these canteens.[7 12G H] (10) If that is so, then these employees would also be entitled to be treated as railway servants.A classification made between the employees of the two types of canteens would be unreasonable and will have no rational nexus with the purpose of the classification.Surely it cannot be argued that the employees who otherwise do the same work and work under the same conditions and under a similar manage ment have to be treated differently merely because the canteen happens to be 691 run at an establishment which employees 250 or less than 250 members of the staff.[712H; 713A B] Non Statutory Non Recognised Canteens (11) These canteens are run at establishments which employ 100 or less than 100 employees, and are established without prior approval or recognition of the Railway Board.[692E] The Canteens are run more or less on ad hoc basis, the Railway Administration having no control of their function ing.They are not required to be managed either as per the provisions of the Railway Establishment Manual or the Admin istrative Instructions.In the circumstances the workers engaged in these canteens are not entitled to claim the status of the railway servants.[713H; 714A]\", 'With a view to encourage national integration, a few States including respondent states agreed upon an arrangement by which a certain percentage of the seats in medical colleges was reserved for candidates from other States on a reciprocal basis.In the year 1982 83 the respondent States made some nominations under the above arrangement.The validity of these nominations was challenged in these writ petitions and civil appeals on the ground, inter alia, that these nominations had been made by the State Governments in their absolute and arbitrary discretion, without reference to any objective criterion, or any controlling norms or guidelines.Partly allowing the writ petitions and the appeals, ^ HELD: The principle adopted by the State Governments of nominating candidates in their absolute and unfettered choice to seats in Medical Colleges outside the State is invalid.But the nominations already made will not be affected.[991 F G; E] The exercise of all administrative power vested in public authority must be structured within a system of controls informed by both relevance and reason relevance in relation to the object which it seeks to serve, and reason in regard to the manner in which attempts to do so.article 14 of the Constitution is violated by powers and procedures which in themselves result in unfairness and asbitrariness.There is no doubt that in the realm of administrative power the element of discretion may properly, find place, where the statute or the nature of the power intends so.But there is a well recognised distinction between an administrative power to be exercised within defined limits in the reasonable discretion of designated authority and the vesting of an absolute and uncontrolled power in such authority.One is power controlled by law countenanced by the Constitution, the other falls outside the Constitution altogether.Proceeding from there, it is evident that if the State 986 Government desires to advance the objective of national integration it must adopt procedures which are reasonable and are related to the objective.In this Age of Reason, all law must measure upto that standard, and necessarily so also must all executive acts.[989 E F; 989 G; 990 A D] In the present cases, viewed in this context and tested on the touchstone of our constitutional values, the claim of the State Government that the nature of the objective and the means adopted to serve it entitle it legitimately to vest in itself an absolute power in choosing candidates for nomination is to deny a fundamental principle of our constitutional life and cannot be allowed to prevail.[990 D

State in the light of the observations contained in this judgment.Until a policy is so formulated and concrete criteria are embodied in the procedure selected, the nominations shall be made by selecting candidates strictly on the basis of merit, the candidates nominated being those, in order of merit, immediately below the candidates selected for admission to the Medical Colleges of the

treatment of any disease or condition specified in the Schedule to the Act.Section 7 of the Act makes it penal to contravene any of the provisions of the Act.The appellant inserted an advertisement in a newspaper to the effect that he would treat diseases \"with new methods, new machines of science and electric treatment\".He was prosecuted under section 7 read with section 3 of the Act and was convicted and sentenced.The High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence.On appeal to this Court.it was contended that the particular advertisement did not refer to any \"drug\" and, therefore, the provisions of the Act were not attracted.Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: \"Machines of science\" designed to confer on mankind the blessings of \"New Life, New Vigour, New Spirit, New Wave\" advertised by the appellant are most likely to trap the ignorant and the unwary.The articles of commerce which the appellant had banefully advertised must be brought within the mischief of the Act.[784 GH] (1) Any article other than food which is intended to affect or influence in any way any organic function of the body of a human being is a drug within the meaning of that provision.The so called \"machines of science\" or of \"electric treatment\" whose magically curative properties were advertised by the appellant are articles intended to influence the organic function of the human body.[784C] (2) A machine is a tangible thing which can both be seen and felt and as such, it answers the description of an article within the meaning of section 2(b)(iii) of the Act.A machine is

confer distinct benefits on the workmen and give some additional jurisdiction and power to the authorities mentioned therein.Section 33 A enjoins the Tribunal to decide the complaint \"as if it were a dispute referred to or pending before it\" and to submit its award to the appropriate Government and provides that the provisions of the Act shall apply to the award.The provisions of these two new sections 33 and 33 A of the 1947 Act correspond to and are in pari materia with the provisions of sections 22 and 23 of the 1950 Act and are more or less in similar terms.A ban has been put by section 22 of 1950 Act and section 33 of the 1947 Act upon the ordinary right, which the employer has under the ordinary law governing a contract of employment with a view to protect the workmen against victimisation by the employer and to ensure the termination.of the proceedings in connection with industrial disputes in a peaceful atmosphere and the only thing that the authority is called upon to

declarations made by the deceased.The two eye witnesses supported the prosecution case only partly and were, therefor, permitted to be cross examined by the Public Prosecutor.The Sessions Judge thought it unsafe to rely on the testimony of the two eye witnesses and was also not impressed by and of the dying declarations.Consequently he acquitted the appellants.The High Court in appeal did not discard the evidence of the eye witnesses but utilised it by way of corroboration to the dying declarations.The High Court set aside the order of acquittal and convicted the appellants under section 30 read with section 34 I.P.C. and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for life.In an appeal under section 2(1) of the .^ HELD: 1.The Sessions Court rightly discarded the evidence of the hostile eye witnesses.They resiled from their Police, Statements and it is evident that they have no regard for truth.Their evidence cannot be used to corroborate the dying declarations.[766 C] 2.In regard to the dying declarations the Sessions Court wholly overlooked the earliest dying declaration which was made by the deceased soon after the incident.The second dying declaration was the first information report lodged by the deceased at the Police Station.The Sessions Judge was clearly in error in holding that the first information report cannot be treated as a dying declamation.After making the statements before the police the deceased succumbed to his injuries and, therefore, the statement can be treated as a dying declaration, and is admissible under section 32(1) of the Evidence Act, The maker of tho statement is dead and the statement relates to the cause of his death.[766DF] 3.It is, well settled that though a dying declaration must be approached with caution for the reason that the maker of the statement cannot be subjected to cross examination, there is neither a rule of law nor a rule of prudence that a dying declaration cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated.[766G] 4.Law does not require that the maker of the dying declaration must cover the whole incident or narrate the case history.What is necessary is that the whole of the statement made by the deceased must be laid before the court without tampering with its terms or its tenor.[767 C] 5.The deceased did not bear any enmity or hostility towards the appellants nor did any other persons who were in the company of the deceased after the assault were shown to have any animus for implicating the appellants false.[767E] 765 6.The second dying declaration was not made to the Investigating officer.It was made by way of First Information Report and it was only after the information was recorded that the investigation commenced.The High Court was right in relying on the first and second dying declarations.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case these two dying declarations can be accepted without corroboration.[767F, 768C] 7.The High Court ought not to have relied on the third dying declaration which is said to have been made by the deceased in the hospital.The Investigating officer ought to have requisitioned the services of a Magistrate for re cording that dying declaration, Investigating officers are naturally integrated in the success of the investigation and the practice of the Investigating Officer himself recording a dying declaration during the course of investigation ought not to be encouraged.[768CD] 8.The High Court in reversing the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions rt did not violate any of the principles governing appeals against

of Orissa Forest Service Class II Service.The 18 selected candidates were sent for training at the Indian Forest College during the year 1965 67.One of the candidates, who successfully completed the training was appointed to Class 11 Service.He filed a writ petition in the High Court, as he was assigned in the list of gradation a rank junior to the promotees, who were confirmed by Service Commission after his recruitment The High Court held that the recruitment to class II Service was complete only after successful completion of two years \\' training in the Forest College.The appeals by special leave flied against the High Courts 242 Judgment were dismissed by this Court.In 1979, the respondent No. 1 (in all the present appeals) was directly recruited to the Orissa State Forest Service Class II by the State Commission.He was appointed as an Assistant Conservator of Forests, after his completion of training for two years at the Forest Service College.Respondent No. 1 moved the Administrative Tribunal challenging the seniority of the Forest Rangers, who were members of the Orissa Subordinate Forest Service and were promoted as Assistant Conservators of Forests, when the respondent was undergoing his training.Respondent contended before the Tribunal that the seniority of direct recruits vis a vis the promotees required to be decided on the basis of the Orissa Forest Service Class II Recruitment Rules, 1959; that his services should be reckoned from the date of recruitment Itself and not from the date of actual appointment; that the exclusion of the period of two years \\' training from the purposes of reckoning the seniority was illegal; and that the appointment of the promotees in excess of the quota prescribed by the Rules and in the absence of any specific order of Government providing otherwise was illegal.Allowing the petition, the Tribunal held that the respondent No.1 (in the present appeals) was entitled to be treated as a direct recruit of 1979 and he be confirmed and promoted on being direct recruit of 1979 and his seniority to be fixed on the basis of being a direct recruit of 1979 within the 2/3rd quota for direct recruits.The present appeals by special leave were preferred by the aggrieved parties against the judgment of the Tribunal.The appellant in SLP (C) No. 1604 of 1992 submitted that the respondent No.1 was selected for undergoing superior Forest Service Course at the Forest Service College in 1979; that having regard to the terminology of the order which stated, \"he was selected\", it could not be held that he could lay a claim to the post; that the Tribunal had gone wrong in its interpretation of the rules that having held that both the direct recruits as well as the promotees were to undergo probation for a period of two years, the period of training for the direct recruit could not count as service; that the ratio of 2/3rd and 1/3rd between direct recruits 243 and promotees did not apply, if the Government provided otherwise; that the Civil List corrected upto 1982 was published in 1985; and that the judgment of the Tribunal resulted in unsettling the settled matters, hence same to be reversed.The State adopted the arguments of the appellant in SLP (C) No. 1604/92.The respondent No.1 submitted that recruitment was different from appointment; that when an officer was recruited to Class 11 Service if did not mean that only from the date of appointment his seniority was to be reckoned, that the argument that the period of training to be excluded merely because both the direct recruits as well as the promotees undergo probation was untenable; that when rules specifically prescribed the quota as 2/3rd and 1/3rd, the Government could not wriggle out of the situation that a saving provision was made which was factually not so in this case; that the point relating to laches which was never argued before the Tribunal, could not be raised before the Court.Allowing the appeals, this court, HELD, 1.01.The term \\'recruitment \"connotes and clearly signifies enlistment, acceptance, selection or approval for appointment Certainly, this Is not actual appointment or posting in service.In contradistinction, the word \\'appointment \\' means an actual act of posting a person to a particular office.[253E] 1.02.Recruitment is just an initial process. \\'Mat may lead to eventual appointment in service.But, that cannot tantamount to an appointment.No doubt, Rule 5 talks of recruitment to Class 11 Service.[253E] 1.03.Nowhere in the Recruitment Rules of 1959 it is specified that the services of a direct recruit under the Government shall be reckoned from the date of selection in the competitive examination.On the contrary, Regulation 12(c) is very clear that the period of training is not to be reckoned as Government service.[253F] 1.04.Under Regulation 12 the finally selected candidates are required to undergo two years training.During the period of pendency & consolidated monthly allowance of Rs. 150 as stipend is paid.Under clause (b) of that Regulation he is required to execute a bond provided for 244 in Appendix A. Regulation 12 (c) in unmistakable terms says the period of training will not count as service under Government.Such service will count only from the date of appointment to the service after successful completion of the course of training.[253B C] 1.05.After the successful completion of training when the appointment order Is issued the direct recruits are put on probation.Similar Is in the case of the promotees.Both of them undergo probation.[253G] 1.06.The seniority of direct recruits will have to be reckoned only from the date of appointment and not from the date of recruitment.[253G] 2.01.The Government had clearly taken a decision to increase the number of posts to be filled up by promotion in excess of the 1/3rd of total posts in the cadre on administrative grounds connected with nationalisation of Kendu Leaf Trade in 1972 73 in the interest of public due to non availability of direct candidates trained In the Indian Forest College, Dehradun.[256G] 2.02.It is not correct to say that Government have decided that the quota of direct recruitment which will be encroached upon by the promotees will be released as and when direct recruits are available.[256H] 2.03.Hence, to contend that the promotees would obviously have to yield to direct recruits who came in subsequently within their quota and would consequently also not be eligible for seniority above direct recruits, is untenable.[257D] 2.04. ]Me promotions given in excess of 1/3rd quota are valid.There is no justification to push down the promotees in seniority.The promotion in excess of the prescribed quota was necessitated by the exigencies and in the intersest of the public.It is supported by a conscious decision of the Government which is permissible under Rule 5(3).[258D] Keshav Chandra Joshi and Ors.vs Union of India, [1990] Supp. 2 SCR 573 at page 586, distinguished.Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers Association and Ors.vs State of Maharashtra and Ors., ; at page 938; SLP (C) No. 1624 of 1988 Disposed of on 18.01.89; CA.2051 52 of 1974 Disposed of on 7.1.88, referred to.245 3.01.By the operation of deeming clause it only enables appointments made under 1959 Rules to be continued under 1984 Rules.Certainly, by the repeal of 1959 Rules It cannot mean all those appointments cease.Nor again, the substantive provision of Rule 16 would govern.Therefore, Rule 24 has no application.[256A B] 3.02.Since the appointments in question have been made under 1959 Rules, 1984 Rules will be inapplicable.The 1984 Rules, came into force only when they were published in the Official Gazette on December 21, 1984.Explanation under Rule 16 is a substantive provision.Therefore, it cannot be retrospective.As regards Rule 24, the proviso clearly states that the Rules cannot be construed as affecting on invalidating the appointments already made.Therefore, if any right has been acquired or any privilege had accrued that would remain unaltered.Therefore, these appointments which are governed by the 1959 Rules will continue not withstanding the repeal.[254H, 255A B] 3.03.Since the appointments in question are regulated under Orissa Forest Service Class 11 Recruitment Rules, the Indian Forest Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations of 1966 have no application.The Orissa Rules were framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India and have statutory and binding force.[258F] G.P. Singh: Principles of Statutory Interpretation Fourth Edition 1988, at page 208, referred to.There have been laches on the part of the direct recruits in seeking the remedy.When the list was published in 1985 nothing prevented them to approach earlier.This is the point to be put against them.[258G] 4.02.The gradation list has been in operation over several years.There is no reason to unsettle the settled position.[256E] Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers \\' Association vs State of Maharashtra and others; , , referred to.']\n"
